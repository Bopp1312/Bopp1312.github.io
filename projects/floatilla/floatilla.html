    <p dir="auto">I grew up in the midwest, and throughout my college years, my friends and I would enjoy spending
      weekends going on float trips. Gently floating down the river as a group over the course of an afternoon was
      always a unique experience. After I moved to the west-coast I realized, gentle rivers perfect for floating were
      just out of reach residing mostly in northern California. </p>
    <p dir="auto">To solve this problem I decided that would create a slow moving vessel that would provide a platform
      to support coolers, snacks and seating, additionally this vessel would be capable of towing numerous other
      floaters riding inner-tubes. I found an inflatable dock on the internet and decided it would make a perfect
      structure for the Floatilla since it was relatively cheap and spacious. </p>
    <h1 data-heading="Drag Experiment" dir="auto">Drag Experiment</h1>
    <p dir="auto">I needed to determine the drag that the inflatable dock would have as it moved through the water, as
      well as estimate the drag for a person being towed in an inner-tube.<br>
      To estimate the drag coefficients I devised a bucket and pulley system in which a bucket holding a known amount of
      water would be released from a height and then the rope was routed through a pulley system with 4x reduction
      before going out across the water to the subject.<br>

      Starting with the line completley taught the bucket would be released from a known height with a known mass and
      then would descend a known
      distance as the subject floating on the surface of the water is then pulled through the water by a constant
      pulling force. By measuring the time it takes for the bucket to descend a certain distance it was then possible to
      calculate the average velocity of the subject which experienced a constant force. Thus the Drag coefficient could
      be determined by solving the Drag equation for C_d
    </p>

      This plot shows the results fo the drag experiment, where 3 different test subjects were used. Multiple idential
      trials were run
      to provide an average value for each data point, and ensure accuracy.

    <blockquote>
      By plotting the C_d as a function of Velocity it can be seen that the rate of change in C_d decreases as V
      increases.
      This sensitivity study was very useful, and meant that for my results to be most accurate I should use as much
      mass
      in the bucket as possible, so I could ensure the steady state velocity achieved was suffeciently high and therefore
      less susceptible to error when estimating the drag coefficient C_d.

    <h1 data-heading="Power and Energy Study" dir="auto">Power and Energy Study</h1>
    By knowing the drag coefficient of both the Floatilla platform as well as a person riding an inner-tube it was
    possible to estimate the power required to tow various numbers of people at different speeds. Using the drag
    equation to determine the drag force at a given speed for the estimated towing load (people, tubes). I was able to
     then determine that approximatley 2.5Kwh was a suffecient amount of energy to tow 6 people on inner-tubes at a
     speed of 2mph for a duration of 4 hours.
