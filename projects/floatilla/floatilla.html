    <p dir="auto">I grew up in the midwest, and throughout my college years, my friends and I would enjoy spending
      weekends going on float trips. Gently floating down the river as a group over the course of an afternoon was
      always a unique experience. After I moved to the west-coast I realized, gentle rivers perfect for floating were
      just out of reach residing mostly in northern California. </p>
    <p dir="auto">To solve this problem I decided that would create a slow moving vessel that would provide a platform
      to support coolers, snacks and seating, additionally this vessel would be capable of towing numerous other
      floaters riding inner-tubes. I found an inflatable dock on the internet and decided it would make a perfect
      structure for the Floatilla since it was relatively cheap and spacious. </p>
    <h1 data-heading="Drag Experiment" dir="auto">Drag Experiment</h1>
    <p dir="auto">I needed to determine the drag that the inflatable dock would have as it moved through the water, as
      well as estimate the drag for a person being towed in an inner-tube.<br>
      To estimate the drag coefficients I devised a bucket and pulley system in which a bucket holding a known amount of
      water would be released from a height and then the rope was routed through a pulley system with 4x reduction
      before going out across the water to the subject.<br>

      <img src="experimental_setup.png" alt="Floatilla Testing Setup" height="400 px"><br>

      Starting with the line completley taught the bucket would be released from a known height with a known mass and
      then would descend a known
      distance as the subject floating on the surface of the water is then pulled through the water by a constant
      pulling force. By measuring the time it takes for the bucket to descend a certain distance it was then possible to
      calculate the average velocity of the subject which experienced a constant force. Thus the Drag coefficient could
      be determined by solving the Drag equation for C_d
    </p>

      This plot shows the results fo the drag experiment, where 3 different test subjects were used. Multiple idential
      trials were run
      to provide an average value for each data point, and ensure accuracy.

    <blockquote>
      By plotting the C_d as a function of Velocity it can be seen that the rate of change in C_d decreases as V
      increases.
      This sensitivity study was very useful, and meant that for my results to be most accurate I should use as much
      mass
      in the bucket as possible, so I could ensure the steady state velocity achieved was suffeciently high and
      therefore
      less susceptible to error when estimating the drag coefficient C_d.

    <h1 data-heading="Power and Energy Study" dir="auto">Power and Energy Study</h1>
    By knowing the drag coefficient of both the Floatilla platform as well as a person riding an inner-tube it was
    possible to estimate the power required to tow various numbers of people at different speeds. Using the drag
    equation to determine the drag force at a given speed for the estimated towing load (people, tubes). I was able to
    then determine that approximatley 2.5Kwh was a suffecient amount of energy to tow 6 people on inner-tubes at a
    speed of 2mph for a duration of 4 hours.

    <h1 data-heading="Construction" dir="auto">Construction</h1>
    The construction of the Floatilla involved addressing three main issues how would the motors attach and what would
    house the motors, and where would all the electronics go.
    <h2 data-heading="Motor mounts" dir="auto">Motor Mounts</h2>
    The motor mounts had to address the problem of securely attaching the motorized fins to the underside of the PVC
    based
    inflatable drop stick platform. <br>

    <img src="motor_mount_2.jpeg" alt="Completed motor mount with brass inserts " height="200 px"
      style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <br>
    To achieve a solid and stable mounting point I chose to use PVC stock material; rectangular segments 1/8" thick.
    The material was choosen due to the high bonding strength required; PVC to PVC results in the highest strength. To
    glue the mounts
    to the platform I used HH-66 PVC cement which chemically bonds the wo mateials with a native PVC bond with the glue
    itslef being PVC based.
    To ensure the attachment plates would be durable I applied PVC fabirc alonght the perimeter of the plates ensuring
    that
    the full assemply would not be pryed from the platform.
    <br>
    <h2 data-heading="Motor Housing" dir="auto">Motor Housing</h2>
    The motor housing attaches the motor to the fin. The Motor has 4 screws distributed radially along the front edge.
    <br>

    <blockquote>
      The motor housing features cooling veins which allow water to flow through
      the front of the housing along the side of the motor and out in to the
      propeller area. Additionally the moro mousing adapts the "soda can" shape of
      the motor into a streamlined profile that also connects to the top of the fin.

      This shows the completed first version of the motor housing and fin. Brass inserts were used to secure
      the M4 fasteners across the friction joint ensuring no movement and effective load transfering to the fin with
      no stress concentrations.

    <h2 data-heading="Electonics Box" dir="auto">Electronics Box</h2>
    The electronics box consists of a waterproof tote that was modified to allow
    for the cables powering the motors to pass through. The electonics served as
    the enclosure for the battery, motor controller, fuse, and flight controller.
